# Budget App
> This projects aims at challenging my Python, SQL and Qt skills

## The Objective
What I want is a budget application that allows me to:
- **track expenses** : each expense will possess a tag that indicates its category (shopping, bills, groceries...)
- **Budget goal** : it will be possible to create a budget goal for each category OR for each month
    - Like the user can either say "i shouldn't spend more than 200 euros on groceries each month "    
    - or "i shouldn't use more than 800 euros this month"
    - can do both : "i shouldn't use more than 800 euro this month, including 200 euro max for groceries"
- **Savings tracker** : the user can set saving goals for each month (could be the same every month or not) and the app should display (a graph would be cool) how much the user actually saved and display whether the goal has been reached (you saved 50% of your goal) 

I think that's enough for now :)
